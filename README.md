# MorQuest Code
## Morphodynamic Quick Assessment of Estuarine development under climate change

The MorQuest code predicts the reaction of estuaries from changes in sea level or sediment supply in a given period. The next Figure shows the relationship of the hydrodynamic elements that produce the change in the volume of sediments, of which the equilibrium state of some elements is described based on empirical equilibrium relationships.

The assumptions that the model develops are:
-	The model proposes a system defined by input parameters in equilibrium, which resolves that the amount of sediments input to the model is transported along the channel, the coast and outwards.
-	The model is applied to short tidal basins (1/20 of the tidal wavelength), implying that the water level gradients are negligible.
-	The model assumes that the systemsâ€™ reaction to SLR can be represented by a single adaptation time scale.

The code develops calculation based on: i) sediment transport, ii) hydrodynamic changes, iii) expansion of the intertidal area based on the sediment supplement of the river, iv) changes of the coastline under the variation of sea level, and v) time adaptation scale.

### Project description

The Morquest code addresses the fundamental question:How can we globally assess the impact of climate change on estuarine morphodynamics at first order?
Therefore, the interest and development of the code were based on the following objectives:

-Utilizing satellite imagery as the primary data source.
-Developing a model capable of conducting simulations with limited data availability.
-Performing calibration of the developed model.
-Conducting long-term projections to provide valuable insights for sustainable coastal management.
