# MorQuest Code
## Morphodynamic Quick Assessment of Estuarine development under climate change

The MorQuest code predicts the reaction of estuaries from changes in sea level or sediment supply in a given period. The next Figure shows the relationship of the hydrodynamic elements that produce the change in the volume of sediments, of which the equilibrium state of some elements is described based on empirical equilibrium relationships.
