# MorQuest Code
## Morphodynamic Quick Assessment of Estuarine development under climate change

The MorQuest code predicts the reaction of estuaries from changes in sea level or sediment supply in a given period. The next Figure shows the relationship of the hydrodynamic elements that produce the change in the volume of sediments, of which the equilibrium state of some elements is described based on empirical equilibrium relationships.

![Estuaries](https://github.com/mreyesc22/MorQuestCode/assets/43484469/f1890802-57ee-44f9-b8be-59ba0fa1fd85)

The assumptions that the model develops are:
-	The model proposes a system defined by input parameters in equilibrium, which resolves that the amount of sediments input to the model is transported along the channel, the coast and outwards.
-	The model is applied to short tidal basins (1/20 of the tidal wavelength), implying that the water level gradients are negligible.
-	The model assumes that the systemsâ€™ reaction to SLR can be represented by a single adaptation time scale.

The code develops calculation based on: 
1. Sediment transport, 
2. Hydrodynamic changes, 
3. Expansion of the intertidal area based on the sediment supplement of the river, 
4. Changes of the coastline under the variation of sea level
5. Time adaptation scale.

### Project description

The Morquest code addresses the fundamental question: **How can we globally assess the impact of climate change on estuarine morphodynamics at first order?**

Therefore, the interest and development of the code were based on the following objectives:

- Utilizing satellite imagery as the primary data source.
- Developing a model capable of conducting simulations with limited data availability.
- Performing calibration of the developed model.
- Conducting long-term projections to provide valuable insights for sustainable coastal management.
  
The theoretical foundation and development of the code are detailed in the research conducted by Reyes, M (2023). This analysis is delineated in the thesis titled **"Assessing Sea Level Rise Impact on Estuarine Morphodynamics"** submitted to obtain the academic degree of Master in Water and Sustainable Development at IHE Delft. You can access the thesis via the following link:https://ihedelftrepository.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/masters1/id/338392

## 1. Installation<a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1 Create an environment with Anaconda

To run the toolbox you first need to install the required Python packages in an environment. To do this we will use **Anaconda**, which can be downloaded freely [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

Once you have it installed on your PC, open the Anaconda prompt (in Mac and Linux, open a terminal window) and use the `cd` command (change directory) to go the folder where you have downloaded this repository (e.g., `C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\morQuest`).

Create a new environment named `morQuest` with all the required packages by entering these commands in succession:

```
conda create -n morQuest
conda activate morQuest

conda install pandas
conda install numpy scipy
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib notebook -y
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas -y
```
All the required packages have now been installed and are self-contained in an environment called `morQuest`. Always make sure that the environment is activated with:

```
conda activate morQuest
```

To confirm that you have successfully activated morQuest, your terminal command line prompt should now start with (`morQuest`).

:warning: **In case errors are raised** :warning:: clean things up with the following command (better to have the Anaconda Prompt open as administrator) before attempting to install `morQuest` again:
```
conda clean --all
```
## 2. Usage<a name="usage"></a>

An example of how to execute the software in a Jupyter Notebook is available in the repository (`morQuest_Simple.ipynb`). To run it, activate your `morQuest` environment with `conda activate morQuest` (if it's not already active) and then type:
```
jupyter notebook
```

A web browser window will open. Point to the directory where you downloaded this repository and click on `morQuest_Simple.ipynb`. A Jupyter Notebook combines formatted text and code. To run the code, place your cursor inside one of the code sections and click on the `run cell` button (or press `Shift` + `Enter`) and progress forward.

![00_Initial_Setting](https://github.com/mreyesc22/MorQuestCode/assets/43484469/715218dd-21e4-45fc-aaea-f6bc3d6a2328)

The following sections provide an example of running the complete **Alsea Bay (USA)** workflow.

## 3. Manual data input
### 3.1  Define study area
For this example, we will input the **Data Manually**. Therefore, this Jupyter notebook file can be used to conduct the analysis in a general manner.

![01_Study_Area](https://github.com/mreyesc22/MorQuestCode/assets/43484469/befb4739-d356-4691-98bc-aaa6e68f7bf0)

### 3.2 Input Data
In the initial phase of the study, the focus lies on the selection of comprehensive datasets that furnish sufficient information for subsequent analysis. Following this, the subsequent step involves gathering pertinent data, encompassing intertidal area (`Ai`), channel area (`Ac`), tidal difference (`dH`), river flow (`Qr`),change in sediment supply (`ssc`), closure depth (`cd`), dune height (`du`), active shorezone slope (`betas`), and sea level projection (`slr`). 

Furthermore, calibration and sensitivity parameters within the model were identified, as listed below.

- `incAi`: Rate of annual intertidal area expansion. 
- `erc`: Factor governing the entrapment of river-supplied sediment from the river into the channel.
- `ecs`: Factor controlling the entrapment of river-supplied sediment from the channel into the shoreline.
- `fis`: Factor for transport from river to intertidal area under river sediment supply change.
- `fs`: Factor responsible for the distribution of intertidal area deposition to intertidal area width and channel slope.
- `si`: Factor influencing the increase in intertidal area slope at its edge.
- `faw`: Factor responsible for reducing `fs` and `fis` in case of a decrease in yearly sediment transport from the river into the channel.

## 4. Automated access to input values
The automated version was developed by analyzing a case study of the **U.S. West Coast**, which encompasses around **8 estuaries**. A collection of photographs depicting the studied estuaries is also included.
Additionally, in the Data folder, you will find the formats and references of the information sources that have been used in the code. 

An example of how to execute the software in a Jupyter Notebook is available in the repository (`morQuest_CaseStudy.ipynb`). To run it, activate your `morQuest` environment with `conda activate morQuest` (if it's not already active) and then type:
```
jupyter notebook
```

*Note:These formats and references can be adapted for other estuaries or for any other applications that you may wish to apply them to.*

### 4.1 Initial settings
Compared to the simple routine (`morQuest_Simple.ipynb`), data collection functions were added in this Jupyter file.

![01_initial_conditions](https://github.com/mreyesc22/MorQuestCode/assets/43484469/7cbfec6d-2955-4ed3-a85d-29c8d667e2d8)

### 4.2 Photo Panel
A photographic view of the analyzed estuaries will now be presented.

![02_CaseStudy](https://github.com/mreyesc22/MorQuestCode/assets/43484469/42ec1fcc-5a6f-4812-a344-ccd2e2741c32)

You must indicate the estuary under analysis.

*Note: place the same name as indicated on the photographic panel.*

### 4.3 Input Data
In the initial phase of the study, the focus lies on the selection of comprehensive datasets that furnish sufficient information for subsequent analysis. Following this, the subsequent step involves gathering pertinent data, encompassing intertidal area (`Ai`), channel area (`Ac`), tidal difference (`dH`), river flow (`Qr`), closure depth (`cd`) and active shorezone slope (`betas`).

### 4.4 Execution of the code
After acquiring the data, the model is executed similarly to the jupyter `morQuest_Simple.ipynb`example. 
As part of the project's case study, we processed the values previously calculated from satellite information (which can be found in the references). The rest of the values were entered manually, and you can find them detailed in the investigation report. 
During the calibration phase, we determined that the `si` factor was the most sensitive, with a characteristic value ranging from `0.06 to 0.13` for U.S West Coast.
